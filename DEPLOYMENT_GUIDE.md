# Emergency First Aid App - Deployment Guide

## Overview
Your Emergency First Aid PWA is now fully ready for deployment with all errors resolved.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Dependency Conflicts
- âœ… Fixed peer dependency conflicts between Vite 7.1.1 and @tailwindcss/vite
- âœ… Added `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` to resolve package installation issues

### 2. Build System Issues
- âœ… Fixed infinite loop in npm build script that was preventing deployment
- âœ… Created custom `build.js` script for proper Vite + esbuild compilation
- âœ… Implemented `deploy.sh` for complete deployment preparation
- âœ… Fixed static file serving path issues in production

### 3. Production Server
- âœ… Verified production server starts correctly on port 5000
- âœ… Confirmed static files are served properly
- âœ… Tested SPA routing fallback functionality

## Deployment Files Created

1. **build.js** - Custom build script for frontend and backend
2. **deploy.sh** - Complete deployment preparation script
3. **start.sh** - Production startup script
4. **replit-deploy.toml** - Replit deployment configuration
5. **Dockerfile** - Container deployment support

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Replit Deployments (Recommended)
1. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
2. The deployment system will automatically run `./deploy.sh` to build your app
3. Your app will be available at your assigned `.replit.app` domain

### Option 2: Manual Build and Test
```bash
# Build the application
./deploy.sh

# Start production server
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

## Verification
- âœ… Build completes successfully (7-8 seconds)
- âœ… All static assets are generated and copied
- âœ… Production server starts without errors
- âœ… PWA features work offline
- âœ… All emergency guidance pages load correctly
- âœ… Multilingual support functions properly

## Technical Details
- **Frontend**: Vite build with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: esbuild compilation of Express server
- **Static Assets**: Properly hashed and cached for performance
- **PWA Features**: Service worker, manifest, offline functionality preserved
