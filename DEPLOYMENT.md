# Emergency First Aid App - Deployment Guide

## Deployment Fixes Applied

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve deployment errors on Replit.

### Issues Resolved

1. **Port Configuration Mismatch**
   - Updated `replit-deploy.toml` to use standard npm commands
   - Configured production server to use port 5000 with proper binding to `0.0.0.0`
   - Removed unnecessary port configurations from deployment config

2. **Missing SESSION_SECRET Environment Variable**
   - Added `SESSION_SECRET` to `replit-deploy.toml` environment variables
   - Updated production server to handle missing SESSION_SECRET gracefully
   - Created `.env.example` file documenting required environment variables

3. **Build Command Simplification**
   - Changed build command from custom `./deploy.sh` to standard `npm run build`
   - Updated start command from custom script to standard `npm start`
   - Simplified Dockerfile to use standard npm commands

4. **TypeScript Build Issues**
   - Installed missing `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` packages
   - Fixed JSX compilation errors in client code

### Configuration Files Updated

- `replit-deploy.toml`: Simplified build/start commands, added SESSION_SECRET
- `production-server.js`: Enhanced port binding and environment variable handling
- `Dockerfile`: Updated to use standard npm build process
- `.env.example`: Added for environment variable documentation

### Deployment Commands

For production deployment:
```bash
npm run build  # Build the application
npm start      # Start production server
```

### Environment Variables Required

- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=5000`
- `SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret-here`

### Port Configuration

- Application runs on port 5000
- Binds to `0.0.0.0` for external access
- Mapped to external port 80 for web access

## Next Steps

The application is now configured for successful deployment on Replit with:
- Proper port configuration matching deployment requirements
- Required environment variables properly set
- Simplified build process using standard npm commands
- Production server optimized for Replit's deployment environment
